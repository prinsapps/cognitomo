          Want to get involved? We are 100% remote business, allowing you the

        <p>
          We are a group of people with a particular set of skills who have
          joined together to craft great outcomes. All of our employees are
          contractors, and many folks have their own freelance gigs on the side.
          This creates a unique dynamic â€“ giving both personal goals and shared
          goals some time in the limelight. We work to bring you opportunities
          to engage with challenging projects and to open you up to a network of
          talented people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our projects consist of anything and everything within the digital
          landscape. Some of our tasks are constantly evolving, but we are
          always looking for coders, copywriters, visual designers, musicians,
          social media gurus, user experience experts, photographers, bloggers,
          chefs, videographers, and everything in-between (SEO bots do your
          thing). If you have a skill that can be tailored to the internet, we
          want to hear from you.
        </p>

        <Section.H2>Mentorship Program</Section.H2>
        <p>
          Calling all college students, recent graduates, or people looking for
          a career change! Our mentorship program gives you the chance to work
          as a contractor and try your hand in the freelance landscape. There is
          no job description for this role because it is dependent on YOU and
          what YOU want to learn. This is a paid, 100% remote opportunity with
          flexible hours - which we think is pretty sweet.
